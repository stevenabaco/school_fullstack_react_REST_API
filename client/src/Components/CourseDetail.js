							<p>By Joe Smith</p>

							<p>
								High-end furniture projects are great to dream about. But unless
								you have a well-equipped shop and some serious woodworking
								experience to draw on, it can be difficult to turn the dream
								into a reality.
							</p>

							<p>
								Not every piece of furniture needs to be a museum showpiece,
								though. Often a simple design does the job just as well and the
								experience gained in completing it goes a long way toward making
								the next project even better.
							</p>

							<p>
								Our pine bookcase, for example, features simple construction and
								it's designed to be built with basic woodworking tools. Yet, the
								finished project is a worthy and useful addition to any room of
								the house. While it's meant to rest on the floor, you can
								convert the bookcase to a wall-mounted storage unit by leaving
								off the baseboard. You can secure the cabinet to the wall by
								screwing through the cabinet cleats into the wall studs.
							</p>

							<p>
								We made the case out of materials available at most
								building-supply dealers and lumberyards, including 1/2 x 3/4-in.
								parting strip, 1 x 2, 1 x 4 and 1 x 10 common pine and
								1/4-in.-thick lauan plywood. Assembly is quick and easy with
								glue and nails, and when you're done with construction you have
								the option of a painted or clear finish.
							</p>

							<p>
								As for basic tools, you'll need a portable circular saw, hammer,
								block plane, combination square, tape measure, metal rule, two
								clamps, nail set and putty knife. Other supplies include glue,
								nails, sandpaper, wood filler and varnish or paint and shellac.
							</p>

							<p>
								The specifications that follow will produce a bookcase with
								overall dimensions of 10 3/4 in. deep x 34 in. wide x 48 in.
								tall. While the depth of the case is directly tied to the 1 x 10
								stock, you can vary the height, width and shelf spacing to suit
								your needs. Keep in mind, though, that extending the width of
								the cabinet may require the addition of central shelf supports.
