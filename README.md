# <p align="center">Full Stack- SCHOOL APP - Teamtree Project 10</p> 

# <p align="center"><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/full-stack-javascript">TREEHOUSE - FULL STACK </a> TECHDEGREE üëç </p>

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This app builds on the "School REST API" we built for project 9, by adding the Front End to the application. 

The UI allows the user to  :

<ul> 
<li>Login or Create a new user account.</li>
<li>Create new courses, with Markdown</li>
<li>Retrieve information on existing courses</li>
<li>Update or Delete existing courses</li>
</ul>

For security reasons, the app utilizes basic user Authorization to restrict access to information based on users being authorized prior to being able to access the information. 

Restricted functionality includes accessing a course to either update or delete it from the database. Only users authorized as the creators of the course can gain access to these features.



## EXTRA FEATURES & CUSTOM MODS

<ul>
  <li>Added validation to User email to ensure new email accounts are unique and properly formatted</li>
  <li>Added filter to Users GET route to filter out password, createdAt, and updatedAt</li>
  <li>Added validation to Users to handle SequelizeUniqueContraintsError as 400 status code </li>
  <li>Fliter Courses route to not show createdAt and updatedAt</li>
  <li>Add athentication to users to ensure only authenticated users can edit a courses</li>
</ul>

  <li>Javascript</li>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
